# Comparative-Analysis-of-Therapeutic-Strategies-in-Murine-Tumor-Models

## Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis of an experimental therapy applied to murine tumor models. The study involves inoculating mice with CT26 colon tumor cells, followed by treatment with various therapies including Salmonella bacteria and Tumor Necrotic Factor (TNF-α). The dataset and analysis scripts provided here aim to evaluate the impact of these therapies on tumor growth.

## Dataset
The dataset includes murine tumor volume measurements recorded over 21 days, post the administration of four different therapy versions. The therapies are:

(a) 10³ bacteria
(b) 10³ bacteria plus TNF-α
(c) Only TNF-α
(d) 5×10⁶ bacteria
Tumor volumes were recorded at specific time intervals (days 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 17, 21) for each therapy group.

## Analysis Tasks
Tumor Volume Analysis: Calculate average tumor volume and standard deviation at each time point for each therapy group.
Visualization: Plot curves with error bars representing standard deviation and create histograms and box plots for day 21.
Effect of Binning: Analyze the effect of binning on histograms for day 21.
Correlation Analysis: Calculate the correlation matrix between bacteria load and tumor volumes at day 21, with scatter plot visualizations.
Autocorrelation Function: Compute the autocorrelation function for days 9 and 11 to analyze the effect of therapy on tumor volume.
Efficacy Assessment: Identify the most successful treatment using appropriate statistical testing, detailing hypotheses and test methodology.
